# Ai-Driven-Custom-Home-Design-Assistant

Project Description
The Custom Home Design Creator project focuses on developing an AI-powered tool for generating personalized home design plans. The objective is to build a generative model that creates custom home layouts based on user inputs such as preferences, spatial requirements, and architectural styles. By analyzing these inputs, the model produces detailed and aesthetically pleasing home designs that align with the user’s vision and functional needs. This tool aims to simplify the home design process, allowing users to explore and visualize their ideal living spaces efficiently, while providing a creative and personalized approach to home planning and design.

Scenario 1: Real Estate Development
In a real estate development firm, the goal is to offer potential buyers customized home designs based on their preferences. Clients input their desired features, such as the number of bedrooms, architectural style, and special amenities. The Custom Home Design Creator generates personalized home layouts that match these specifications. This approach helps clients visualize their ideal homes and enhances their purchasing experience, similar to how tailored property showcases can drive interest and sales.

Scenario 2: Home Renovation Services
For a home renovation company, the tool is used to create design proposals for clients looking to remodel their existing homes. Users provide details about their current space, renovation goals, and style preferences. The Custom Home Design Creator then generates updated design plans that reflect these inputs, helping clients visualize potential changes. This facilitates the decision-making process and allows for more informed planning, akin to how virtual staging is used in real estate.

Scenario 3: Architectural Firm
In an architectural firm, the tool is utilized to quickly generate preliminary design concepts for clients based on their input. Architects and clients collaborate by specifying requirements such as room layout, design aesthetics, and functional needs. The Custom Home Design Creator produces detailed design drafts that can be refined further. This accelerates the design process and provides a clear starting point for discussions, similar to how initial sketches are used in architectural planning.
 

Project Flow

1.	  User Input via Streamlit UI:
•	Users input a prompt (e.g., topic, keywords) and specify parameters such as the desired length, tone, or style through the Streamlit interface.
2.	Backend Processing with Generative AI Model:
•	The input data is sent to the backend, where it interfaces with the selected Generative AI model (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, etc.).
•	The model processes the input, generating text based on the specified parameters and user input.
5.	Content Generation:
•	The AI model autonomously creates content tailored to the user’s specifications. This could be a blog post, poem, article, or any other form of text.
7.	Return and Display Generated Content:
•	The generated content is sent back to the frontend for display on the Streamlit app.
•	The app presents the content to the user in an easily readable format.
10.	Customization and Finalization:
•	Users can further customize the generated content through the Streamlit UI if desired. This might include editing text, adjusting length, or altering tone.
12.	Export and Usage:
•	Once satisfied, users can export or copy the content for their use, such as saving it to a file or directly sharing it.
Prior Knowledge
To work on a poetry generator project using Streamlit and Google Generative AI, prior knowledge in the following areas is essential:
1.Natural Language Processing (NLP): 
Understanding the basics of NLP is crucial for processing and generating text. Familiarity with  concepts such as tokenization, text generation, and language models is necessary to build a foundation for the project.
2.	Generative AI Models:
  Knowledge of generative models, particularly those like Google's language models, is important. You should understand how these models work, how to fine-tune them, and how to manage parameters like temperature and max tokens to control the output.
3.Python Programming: 
Proficiency in Python is required as it is the primary language used in both Streamlit and Google Generative AI. You should be comfortable writing scripts, handling APIs, and processing data.
4.Streamlit Framework: 
Familiarity with Streamlit is necessary to build the user interface for the poetry generator. You should know how to create interactive web applications, manage user inputs, and display generated text dynamically.

5.	APIs and Integration: 
Understanding how to integrate different tools and services using APIs is important. This includes managing API requests, handling responses, and ensuring the seamless operation of the app.

6.	You must have prior knowledge of the following topics to complete this project.
•	LLM & Gemini Pro:
A large language model is a type of artificial intelligence algorithm that applies neural network techniques with lots of parameters to process and understand human languages or text using self-supervised learning techniques. Tasks like text generation, machine translation, summary writing, image generation from texts, machine coding, chat-bots, or Conversational AI are applications of the Large Languag.e Model. Examples of such LLM models are Chat GPT by open AI, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) by Google, etc.
